# CamEng-Python-Project-yf296
Yuchao Fan's solutions for https://github.com/CambridgeEngineering/PartIA-Computing-Michaelmas, completed during the summer of 2020.
My work is all within the exercises folder, although some of the tutorial notebooks contain extra notes I've made.
Azure notebooks is apparently shutting down in October 2020 so I downloaded the original repository and ran everything locally.
